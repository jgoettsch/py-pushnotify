Installation
------------

If you have already downloaded pushnotify, run the following
commands inside this directory::

    $ python setup.py install
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt


If you have not yet downloaded pushnotify, it would be easier to do
the following::

    $ pip install pushnotify

Either method will install pushnotify into your current environment.
